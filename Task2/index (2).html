		   <p> Introduction: Trees are an essential part of our environment There can be no doubt about the usefulness of trees. We need oxygen for living and trees to provide us with oxygen. Trees cause rainfall and thus prevent the spread of desert. Trees save our land from erosion and maintain the fertility of the soil. Trees give us shade. Trees give us food. We get crops and different delicious and juicy fruits from trees. Trees give shelter to many animals, insects, and birds. In this Way, trees help maintain ecological balance. We also get many products like wood, leaves, rubber, resin, fragrance honey etc. from trees. Paper is made from Wood and bamboo. We use wood as fuel and also need it for making things like houses, boats, and furniture. Trees make our world beautiful. It is very charming to look at trees. But the world is losing its trees in huge amount every year. We cut a lot of trees and destroy many forests for frazzling $30 cities, making new houses and for getting more Wood. If this trend continues, there will not be enough trees for maintaining ecological balances. Many countries are already turning into deserts due to the massive cutting of trees. Many species of birds and animals have also become extinct for want of food and habitat after the destruction of forests. Hence it has become an emergency to plant more trees. In Bangladesh, the rainy season is the best time for the plantation of trees. We can plant trees in any open places. around our houses, office buildings, factories, schools colleges, and hospitals. We should also plant trees on either side of the roads and in all available places.<p> <br />
